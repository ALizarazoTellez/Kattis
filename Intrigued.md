Exercises that I have not been able to solve, that is to say, that have left me intrigued....

## Easy

- [Lamps](https://open.kattis.com/problems/lamps), I do not understand the formula.

## Medium

## Hard

- [Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://open.kattis.com/problems/longincsubseq).
- [Trick](https://open.kattis.com/problems/trick).
